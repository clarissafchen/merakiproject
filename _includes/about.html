                <h2>About This Project</h2>
                <p>As a new designer, sometimes experience is not going to make it the cut to get the job I want.</p>
                <p>This is why I have created this project for my Cisco Meraki job application.</p>
                <p>I want to demonstrate that I am a capable and dedicated individual and that, even though I don't have the years of experience, the heart and passion are definitely there.</p>
                <p>For this project, I decided to do a makeover on the Cisco Meraki logo as well as your Network Dashboard.</p>
